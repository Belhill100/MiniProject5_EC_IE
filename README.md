# Data Sonification Project

## Team Members
- **Emmanuel Collazos**

## Project Description
This project involves creating a data sonification system using Processing and Pure Data. The goal is to take data from a public dataset and visualize it using Processing. As the data is read and visualized, it will produce sounds that consistently represent the information. Once all the information is visualized, it can be graphically modified, creating an interaction between the visual and auditory elements.

## Justification
We chose this approach to leverage the strengths of both Processing and Pure Data. Processing is excellent for data visualization, while Pure Data excels in real-time audio processing. By combining these tools, we can create a dynamic and interactive experience that enhances the understanding of the data through both visual and auditory means.

## Requirements
- **Processing**: For data visualization.
- **Pure Data**: For data sonification.
- **Public Dataset**: The dataset used must be publicly available.

## Repository Structure
- **/"Name"**: Contains the Processing sketch files.

## Limitations
- The project must use both Pure Data and Processing.
- The visualization and sonification must change according to the inserted data.
- Only public datasets/databases are allowed.
- The project must demonstrate how visual and auditory elements change according to the data.
